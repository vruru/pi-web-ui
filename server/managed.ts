/**
 * managed — instances whose updates come from outside.
 *
 * pi-web-ui can update itself: the top bar shows an updates badge and a panel
 * whose buttons run `npm i -g pi-web-ui@latest` in a visible terminal and
 * restart the server. The plugin market installs plugins from the network the
 * same way. On a developer's laptop both are conveniences.
 *
 * Behind a deploy pipeline they are not. A Docker image, a distribution
 * package, or a release script that also checks the reverse proxy, the service
 * unit and the environment variables a new version needs — for all of those,
 * an in-app self-update leaves the machine in a state nothing describes, until
 * the next real deploy silently undoes it. `PI_WEB_MANAGED=1` says "this
 * instance is managed from outside": the update paths refuse, and the client
 * stops offering them.
 *
 * Two rules kept this small:
 *
 * - **The server refuses, the client only hides.** Hiding a button while the
 *   socket still accepts the message is hiding, not disabling: anything that
 *   can open the WebSocket can still send it.
 * - **Nothing else changes.** Chatting, plugins already installed, git,
 *   terminal, settings are untouched — this switch is about who installs
 *   software on the machine, not about what the interface can do.
